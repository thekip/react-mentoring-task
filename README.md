# react-mentoring-task

use `npm start` command to start dev server for frontend

use `backend:watch` or `backend` command to start backend server

or `npm run build` to create a production build


## Remark
I'm not using MovieDb or other service, i wrote my own simple json backend

List of available films you can find in `movies-db.ts` file. 

Basically there only two directors: **Christopher Nolan** and **Quentin Tarantino**

You can play with search by typing their names.
